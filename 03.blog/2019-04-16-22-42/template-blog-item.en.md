---

In 2019, we launch two and a half projects. The first project is a register of created Educational Trails in the protected areas of Russia. The second project is the creation of a detailed route for the Volga River Blue Trail. In addition, we are exploring options for launching a project in the field of biodiversity control. Details will be published as the projects are implemented.
